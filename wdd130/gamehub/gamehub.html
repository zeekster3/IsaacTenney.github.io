<h1>Code And Collaborate With GameHub</h1>
<h1>Connections:</h1>
<h2>
    The ability to connect with others will make this website self-sufficient with the content it produces. By giving people a way to produce games
     together in real-time, it increases how fast they can be made. Also, you can seamlessly allow others to see what you are working on and let 
     them make suggestions which may give you new insights for your project.

    <h1>Public Programing:</h1>
    <h2>
    We plan to make our site have the ability to have a program be editable by multiple people at the same time. This can distribute the workload
     so you can focus on making your project the best it can be. This will easily allow the creation of new teams of people among the community. 
     Your project will be only to those you invite so you can trust who you're working with.
